In the midst of HacktoberFest, President Tim Burchfield (8bit) talks about contibuting to Open Source.

<!--more-->

It's difficult to begin venturing into the world of contributing to open source.  At this meeting we talk about starting to contibute, what to expect and best practices when contributing.

Also included are some approachable projects, including some from current and past members of NDLUG. There are only **five** days left in HacktoberFest at time of posting, **GO, GO, GO!**
