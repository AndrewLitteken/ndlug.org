Everyone say hello to chat.ndlug.org, NDLUG's very own host dedicated to chatting!

<!--more-->

I am excited to finally announce that [chat.ndlug.org](chat.ndlug.org) is finally up and running. This project has been discussed in length before, and we're glad to finally launch it. To accompany the launch, there is some documentation on the features available that will let you know what we offer and how you can connect. 

All of the information regarding how to connect can be found here at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/NDLUG/chat-ndlug-org/blob/master/README.md). In short, we currently host a [Mattermost](mattermost.com) server, IRC bridges for Mattermost AND [Slack](slack.com), (so you can connect to the nd-cse Slack group or our Mattermost using your favorite IRC client) and [ZNC](znc.in) (bouncer software for your IRC connection). To learn more and get connected, go to our [information page](https://github.com/NDLUG/chat-ndlug-org/blob/master/README.md).


Signing off,

Mike "AndroidKitKat" Eisemann
